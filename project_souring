# Supplier Risk & Kraljic Portfolio Analysis

## Executive Summary

This project evaluates supplier and product sourcing risk using a **multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework** combined with the **Kraljic Portfolio Matrix**.
By integrating cost, operational reliability, profit impact, environmental impact, and sourcing concentration, the analysis identifies **where the business is most exposed** and **where procurement actions will have the greatest impact**.

Results show that a **small number of strategic products account for the majority of total spend**, indicating high dependency risk and the need for proactive supplier management.

## Business Problem

Procurement teams often rely on cost-focused supplier evaluations, which can obscure:

* Supply disruption risk
* Single-source and regional concentration risk
* High-profit products with fragile supply bases
* Over-investment in low-impact items

The business needs a **structured, data-driven way** to:

* Prioritize suppliers and products
* Balance cost efficiency with resilience
* Allocate sourcing effort where it matters most

## Methodology

### 1. Data Structuring

* Supplier records defined at **Product × Region** level
* Metrics included:

  * Cost
  * Lead time & variability
  * Order volume
  * Supply risk
  * Profit impact
  * Environmental impact
  * Single-source risk

### 2. Normalization

* All continuous variables normalized to a **0–1 scale**
* Volume normalized using scaling appropriate for skewed distributions
* Binary risks (e.g., single-source) **scaled**, not subtracted

### 3. Weighted Scoring (MCDM)

A composite supplier score was calculated using:

```
Final Weighted Score = Σ (Normalized Metric × Weight)
```

Weights reflect business priorities across:

* Cost
* Lead time
* Volume
* Supply reliability
* Profit impact
* Environmental impact
* Single-source exposure

### 4. Product-Level Aggregation

* Supplier scores aggregated to **product level**
* Weighted averages applied where multiple regions exist
* Logical rules used for single-region and global suppliers

### 5. Kraljic Segmentation

* Products plotted on:

  * **Supply Risk Index (X-axis)**
  * **Profit Impact Index (Y-axis)**
* Classified into:

  * Strategic
  * Leverage
  * Bottleneck
  * Non-Critical

## Results

### Kraljic Portfolio Summary

| Quadrant     | # of Items | Avg Risk | Avg Profit | % of Spend |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Strategic    | 4          | 0.94     | 0.96       | 67%        |
| Leverage     | 12         | 0.71     | 0.50       | 29%        |
| Bottleneck   | 8          | 0.25     | 0.79       | 1%         |
| Non-Critical | 12         | 0.31     | 0.16       | 3%         |

### Key Insights

* **Strategic products dominate total spend**, creating concentration and disruption risk
* **Leverage items offer negotiation and cost-reduction opportunities**
* **Bottleneck items have low spend but high operational sensitivity**
* **Non-critical items consume minimal spend and should be simplified**

---

## Recommendations

### Strategic Items

* Develop long-term supplier partnerships
* Introduce dual sourcing where feasible
* Monitor risk indicators continuously

### Leverage Items

* Increase competitive bidding
* Consolidate volume to improve pricing power

### Bottleneck Items

* Build safety stock or buffers
* Identify alternative suppliers proactively

### Non-Critical Items

* Standardize specifications
* Automate procurement and reduce supplier count

---

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

### Advanced Analytics

* Sensitivity analysis on weights
* Scenario testing (supplier failure, demand spikes)
* Stress testing supply risk assumptions

### Business Extensions

* Time-series risk tracking
* Regional geopolitical risk overlays
* ESG risk weighting by product criticality

### Tools & Visualization

* Power BI or Tableau dashboard
* Automated refresh with ERP/procurement data
* Executive-level risk heatmaps
