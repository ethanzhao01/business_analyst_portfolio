Weights reflect relative business importance across cost, reliability, profit impact, and sustainability.

### 4. Product-Level Aggregation
- Supplier scores aggregated to the **product level**
- Weighted averages used for multi-region products
- Logical rules applied for single-region and global suppliers

### 5. Kraljic Segmentation
Products were positioned on:
- **Supply Risk Index (X-axis)**
- **Profit Impact Index (Y-axis)**

Each product was classified into:
- Strategic
- Leverage
- Bottleneck
- Non-Critical

## Skills Demonstrated
- Supply chain and procurement analytics
- Multi-criteria decision modeling (MCDM)
- Data normalization and aggregation
- Advanced Excel formulas (SUMPRODUCT, IFS, conditional logic)
- Kraljic Portfolio Matrix application
- Translating analysis into business decisions

## Results

### Kraljic Portfolio Summary

| Quadrant        | # of Items | Avg Risk | Avg Profit | % of Spend |
|-----------------|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| Strategic       | 4          | 0.94     | 0.96       | 67%        |
| Leverage        | 12         | 0.71     | 0.50       | 29%        |
| Bottleneck      | 8          | 0.25     | 0.79       | 1%         |
| Non-Critical    | 12         | 0.31     | 0.16       | 3%         |

### Key Insights
- Strategic products dominate spend, creating concentration risk
- Leverage products present negotiation and cost-reduction opportunities
- Bottleneck items have low spend but high operational sensitivity
- Non-critical items should be simplified and automated

---

## Recommendations

### Strategic
- Develop long-term supplier partnerships
- Introduce dual sourcing where feasible
- Actively monitor risk indicators

### Leverage
- Increase competitive bidding
- Consolidate volume to improve pricing power

### Bottleneck
- Build safety stock or buffers
- Identify alternative suppliers proactively

### Non-Critical
- Standardize specifications
- Reduce supplier count and automate purchasing

---

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Sensitivity analysis on scoring weights
- Scenario simulations (supplier failure, demand spikes)
- Integration with BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)
- ESG and geopolitical risk overlays
- Time-series monitoring of supplier risk
